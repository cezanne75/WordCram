{"name":"WordCram","body":"WordCram lets you generate [word\r\nclouds](http://images.google.com/images?q=word+cloud) in Processing.\r\nIt does the heavy lifting -- text analysis, collision detection -- for\r\nyou, so you can focus on making your word clouds as beautiful, as\r\nrevealing, or as silly as you like.\r\n\r\n![Word Cloud by\r\nWordCram](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/raw/master/wordcram.png)\r\n\r\n## Make a Word Cloud\r\n\r\n```java\r\nimport wordcram.*;\r\n\r\n// Set up the Processing sketch\r\nsize(1000, 600);\r\ncolorMode(HSB);\r\nbackground(230);\r\n\r\n// Make a wordcram from a random wikipedia page.\r\nnew WordCram(this)\r\n  .fromWebPage(\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Random\")\r\n  .withColors(color(30), color(110),\r\n              color(random(255), 240, 200))\r\n  .sizedByWeight(5, 120)\r\n  .withFont(\"Copse\")\r\n  .drawAll();\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can control where words appear, what angle they're at, their font,\r\ntheir color, and how they're sized.\r\n\r\n## Install\r\n\r\n[Installing](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/wiki/Install)\r\nWordCram is simple, like any standard Processing library.\r\n\r\n## How do I use this thing? Show me examples!\r\n\r\nMore of these are coming to the wiki, soon!\r\n\r\nBut you can check out the\r\n[tutorials](http://wordcram.org/category/tutorial/) and\r\n[examples](http://wordcram.org/category/examples/) at\r\nhttp://wordcram.org. You can watch WordCram in action, on\r\nOpenProcessing: [popular baby\r\nnames](http://openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=12562), and [the\r\nU.S. Constitution](http://openprocessing.org/visuals/?visualID=12413).\r\n\r\nAnd if you add WordCram to Processing, you can see a bunch of examples\r\nunder File > Examples > Contributed Libraries > WordCram.\r\n\r\n## Problems?\r\n\r\nIf you're running into problems, see the\r\n[FAQ](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/wiki/FAQ), or read the\r\n[javadocs](http://wordcram.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/index.html).\r\n\r\nIf a question has you stumped, and the\r\n[FAQ](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/wiki/FAQ) is no help,\r\nsend me a note. My email account is 'wordcram', and I use gmail.\r\n\r\n## Want a better WordCram?\r\n\r\nWordCram is open-source under the Apache 2 license. That means you can\r\nhelp make it better! I try to keep the source clean so it's easy to\r\nfind your way around. There's a [laundry list of things to\r\ndo](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/wiki/ToDos), and it's easy to\r\n[build WordCram from\r\nsource](https://github.com/danbernier/WordCram/wiki/Build).","tagline":"generate word clouds in Processing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
